I want to devise a strategy of placing orders on Nicehash platform.
I want strategy to yield highest APR. 90% or more if possible.
Device algorithm that would yield highest APR.
Provide tweakable parameters and explanation for them.
I would like to tweak parameters that would adjust to the market conditions:
- algorithms global speed
- algorithms Nicehash speed
- algorithms daily emissions and Nicehash available reward with its speed.
Provide additional possible parameters and algorithm that would check market conditions and adjust to them.

Directions:
- Money will be deployed to Nicehash in 5 minutes intervals.
- How much money will be deployed is not known.
- Whole 5 minute lot money should be deployed.
- Use just algorithms from tokens_data.txt
- When money is deployed, place orders on Nicehash and select speed so orde lasts 1h.
- If orders for the specific algorithms are already running, refill them. If not, place new orders.
- If not money arrives in the 5 minutes intervals for the next hour, leave orders to close at speed they are running at.
- BTC, BCH, RVN and KAS are separate tokens, but DOGE and LTC can be merged mined.
- Check how much Nicehash algorithm speed represents in global hashrate.
- Check block time and block reward in btc.
- The goal is that we have high frequency of blocks mined, but with highest cumulative  reward.

Constraints:
- Use tokens and algorithms data from tokens_data.txt
- Orders placed should now exceed 70% of algorithms daily consumption capacity.
- When capacity for the specific algorithm is exceeded, refill orders of the algorithms that still have capacity.
- If none of the algorithms have capacity, place money into separate accout for later use.
